# September 2019
Kickoff meeting for 2019-20 season

## General Housekeeping
We have over 250 members, but at least 50% of them have never attended a meeting or participated in any way. By having more than 50 members we are forced into a Meetup Pro subscription which costs ~$150/yr. that comes out of pocket.

Since the group primarily works with and talks about Microsoft and .NET based technologies, should we rebrand the group as ".Net Rochester" (rocdotnet.com or dotnetroc.com?) and join the .NET Foundation Meetup group which will pay for our Meetup subscription?

How do we get more engagement from our members? We have a core of about 6 people that regularly attend, with about 6-10 others who come occasionally. What can we do to drive more regular attendance and get more participation (either in attendance or presenting)?
